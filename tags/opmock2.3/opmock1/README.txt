How to compile
==============
You need maven 2.x to compile the Java part of Opmock.
Just typing:

>mvn package

should produce an executable jar file in the target folder. Please
note that this jar file should be renamed to opmock.jar if you
want it to work with the default wrapper script opmock.sh.

Alternatively, the whole Eclipse project is checked in SVN.
If you use the m2eclipse plugin, you should be able to import the
project from SVN and do everything from here.

How to compile SWIG
===================
This is pretty much covered in the SWIG website,

http://http://www.swig.org/

Please refer to this for detailed instructions.

Thanks
