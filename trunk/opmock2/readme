This is the very first version of Opmock 2.
Opmock 1 was based on SWIG and Java, plus some shell scripts;
Opmock 2 is based on Clang/LLVM and is fully written in C++.
The benefits are:

-can parse all of the C and C++ syntax, including obscure constructs
-much faster
-single executable, should allow for easy to use cross platform binaries
(even if for now there are just binaries for Linux)
-And in the future, this opens the door to nifty improvements
like code refactoring, header auto cleaning, and so on.

This first release is dedicated to the C language ONLY.
Don't expect to parse C++ header with it. C++ support will
come eventually, but it will be different of Opmock 1 and hopefully
more powerful.
